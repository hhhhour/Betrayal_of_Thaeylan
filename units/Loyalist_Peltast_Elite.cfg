Some, however, take to them rather well, finding that they have a natural talent in their use. Javelineers are a valuable asset to an army, being able to supplement their skill in melee combat with an ability to handle distant foes. They can hurl javelins into enemy ranks from a distance, often without retribution, and still hold their ground in melee."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_FIRSTSTRIKE}+ _ "This unit has a harass attack which can be used to pin down an enemy. A successful hit on an enemy unit will cause it to lose zone of control until the beginning of its next turn."
