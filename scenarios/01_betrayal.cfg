# Campaign todo
# - 1.15 will support removing overlays. when that happens, add overlay when
#		unit's attacks have been "torched"
# - torchbearer needs miss sound, maybe? seems to have one setup but when
#		they miss it still plays the fire sound
# - arsonist needs torch sound but when adding attack_anim he is not animated

Bitter over the war's toll on his people, Muhyrim held the line for the sake of his men and waited for the day when Ayndun could be opposed openly."
