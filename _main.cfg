    description=_ "King Ayndun makes a desperate pact with Orcish mercenaries that places the Thaeylan kingdom and all the peoples of the south under threat. The commander of his northern army, Field Marshal Muhyrim, must turn his back on the kingdom and seek an alliance with his former opponents.

In his journey through the lawless frontier he will be aided by his closest advisor, Synn, a pathfinder who emerged from the outlands years ago. To restore honor to the Thaeylan kingdom, Muhyrim must rely on the very bandits he once opposed.
